python-ringing-tools
====================

This is a repository containing some trivial python tools to support computational ringing.

It's designed to be easily accessible, and (sadly) probably quite low performance.  Broadly
as long as algorithms complete in 'reasonable' time for typical 6/8 bell requests suitable for a
practice night, that is going to be 'good enough'.
